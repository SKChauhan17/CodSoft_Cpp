Welcome to the repository containing my solutions for the **"C++ Programming Internship"** offered by CodSoft. Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of my completed tasks, showcasing the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the internship.

## Task - 1 : Number Guessing Game
### Objective
The objective of this task is to create a simple Number Guessing Game program. The game generates a random number, and the user is prompted to guess the correct number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, guiding the user to the correct answer.

### Task Details
* **Generate Random Number**
> The program generates a random number as the target for the user to guess.

* **User Input**
> Prompt the user to input their guess.

* **Feedback Loop**
> Provide feedback to the user based on their guess:

>> 1. If the guess is too high, inform the user.

>> 2. If the guess is too low, inform the user.

>> 3. If the guess is correct, congratulate the user and end the game.

* **Repeat Until Correct**
> Continue the guessing process until the user guesses the correct number.

* **User-Friendly Interaction**
> Implement a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.

### Implementation
The implementation includes a C++ program that incorporates the outlined tasks.

## Task - 2 : Simple Calculator
### Objective
The objective of this task is to develop a simple calculator program that enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator allows users to input two numbers and choose operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Task Details
* **User Input**
> Prompt the user to input two numbers.

* **Operation Selection**
> Allow the user to choose from the following operations:

>> Addition

>> Subtraction

>> Multiplication

>> Division

* **Perform Arithmetic Operations**
> Based on user input, perform the selected arithmetic operation.

* **Display Result**
> Display the result of the arithmetic operation to the user.

* **User-Friendly Interaction**
> Implement a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.

### Implementation
The implementation includes a C++ program that facilitates the specified tasks.

## Task - 3 : Tic-Tac-Toe Game
### Objective
The goal of this task is to build a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that enables two players to play against each other. The game involves creating a 3x3 grid, assigning "X" and "O" to players, displaying the game board, and implementing player input, board updates, win/draw checks, player switching, and result display.

### Task Details
* **Game Board**
> Create a 3x3 grid as the Tic-Tac-Toe game board.

* **Players**
> Assign "X" and "O" to two players.

* **Display Board**
> Show the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

* **Player Input**
> Prompt the current player to enter their move.

* **Update Board**
> Update the game board with the player's move.

* **Check for Win**
> Check if the current player has won.

* **Check for Draw**
> Determine if the game is a draw.

* **Switch Players**
> Alternate turns between "X" and "O" players.

* **Display Result**
> Show the result of the game (win, draw, or ongoing).

### Implementation
The implementation includes a C++ program that facilitates the specified tasks.

## TASK - 4 : To-Do List
### Objective
The objective of this task is to create a console-based to-do list manager that enables users to add, view, and delete tasks. The to-do list manager should allow users to input tasks, add tasks to the list, display tasks with their status (completed or pending), mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks from the list.

### Task Details
* **Task Input**
> Allow users to input tasks they want to add to the to-do list.

* **Add Task**
> Implement a function to add tasks to the to-do list.

* **View Tasks**
> Display the list of tasks with their status (completed or pending).

* **Mark Task as Completed**
> Allow users to mark tasks as completed.

* **Remove Task**
> Provide an option to remove tasks from the to-do list.

### Implementation
The implementation includes a C++ program that serves as a console-based to-do list manager. The code provides functionalities for adding, viewing, marking as completed, and removing tasks. It is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward.
